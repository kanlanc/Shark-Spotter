# Shark-Spotter

In 2023, Australia recorded 40% of global fatal unprovoked shark attacks, with 4 deaths occurring that year alone and this is predicted to keep increasing.

This project intention is to use a swarm of light surveillance drones to monitor the shores of these high danger areas so that whenever a shark appears to nib on a quick snack, we can make sure it goes back empty mouth(ed).

This project can be further extended to save people who get swept away by the ocean because of a riptide as well.

This was done using faster RCNN and the model can be fitted on top of any drone tech and transmitted using radio waves.

The first intention was to use an underwater sonnar but after more research, it turns out this can be very disruptive to the underwater ecosystem
